### 675-Assignment-01 - Albuquerque Bikeway Connectvity to Parks and Open Space
#### Proposed workflow:
1. Symbolize trails to show existing and proposed bike trails - use theis to create figure ground
2. Merge parks and open space shapefiles into a single file or symbolize - we may have to make fields match for this to work
3. Verify that CRS on all datasets 
4. Commit all data to JSON
